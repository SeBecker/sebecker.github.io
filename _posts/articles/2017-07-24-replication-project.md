This is the Replication project for the *Effective programming practices for Economists* course from the *Wintersemester 2017*.

The [Project](https://github.com/SeBecker/effective_programming_project) uses a [Template](https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates) by Hans-Martin von Gaudecker to replicate the results from 

* Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Robinson, J. A., & Yared, P. (2008). [Income and Democracy](https://economics.mit.edu/files/9037) *American Economic Review*, 98(3), 808-42.

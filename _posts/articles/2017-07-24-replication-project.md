Replication Project for the Effective programming practices for Economists course from the wintersemester 2017.

The [Project](https://github.com/SeBecker/effective_programming_project) uses a [Template](https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates) by Hans-Martin von Gaudecker to replicate the results from [Income and Democracy](https://economics.mit.edu/files/9037) by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, James A. Robinson, and Pierre Yared in an automated project workflow.

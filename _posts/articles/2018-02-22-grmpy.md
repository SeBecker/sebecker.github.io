[*grmpy*](https://github.com/grmToolbox/grmpy) is an open source Python package for the simulation and estimation of the generalized Roy Model. It serves as a teaching tool to promote the conceptual framework of the generalized Roy model, illustrate a variety of issues in the econometrics of policy evaluation. Moreover it also works as an example for [basic software engineering practices](http://grmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/software_engineering.html) and the associated [documentation processes](http://grmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

The package is used as a teaching tool for a course on the analysis human capital at the University of Bonn. The affiliated lecture material is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/HumanCapitalEconomics/econometrics/blob/master/README.md) .

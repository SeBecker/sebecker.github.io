[grmpy](https://github.com/grmToolbox/grmpy) is an open source Python package for the simulation and estimation of the generalized Roy Model.
It is thought of as a teaching tool to illustrate a broad band of issues regarding the econometrics of policy evaluation and was recently used during a [course](https://github.com/policyMetrics/course) regarding the econometrics of policy evaluation held by [Dr. Eisenhauer](https://www.iame.uni-bonn.de/people/philipp-eisenhauer) in 2017/2018 at the University of Bonn. 
Moreover it also works as an example for [basic software engineering practices](http://grmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/software_engineering.html) and the [documentation process](http://grmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) of software engineering related projects.
